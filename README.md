# Welcome to the **SnipsAndTips** wiki!

This Wiki is a collection of _tips_ and `code snippets` used or that I found that have helped me in the past.

When the information was found on another site or blog post the [link](_none) will always be mentioned. (_sometimes a link disappears or gets archived so I like to note down the key steps_)
